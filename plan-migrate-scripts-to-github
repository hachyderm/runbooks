# Plan: Migration of scripts to github

Plan:

## Github Prep Worke
1.  [X] Create `hachyderm-infra` github account
2.  [x] Add 2FA
3.  [x] Add `hachyderm-infra` to github org
4.  [x] Create ssh keys and add them to the account

## Create repository and copy scripts
1.  [ ] Notify #mastodon-infra
2.  [ ] Take a ZFS snapshot
3.  [ ] Checkout repository to `/opt/scripts`
4.  [ ] Set permissions to root:root 755
5.  [ ] Copy `/home/novix/zfs` to `/opt/scripts/zfs`
6.  [ ] Copy /var/lib/mastodon/run-* to `/opt/scripts/mastodon`
7.  [ ] Submit each script family as a set of pull requests. e.g. zfs, mastodon

## Create README describing how the process will work and describing what is linked
1.  [ ] Fill the README.md and submit as a PR.

## Once scripts are in the repository

The intention is to swap each script with a softlink.

e.g. `/var/lib/mastodon/run-script` would be softlinked to `/opt/scripts/mastodon`

Will populate the path soon.
