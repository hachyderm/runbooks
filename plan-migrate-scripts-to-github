# Plan: Migration of scripts to github

Plan:

## Github Prep Worke
1.  [X] Create `hachyderm-infra` github account
2.  [x] Add 2FA
3.  [x] Add `hachyderm-infra` to github org
4.  [x] Create ssh keys and add them to the account

## Create repository and copy scripts
1.  [ ] Notify #mastodon-infra
2.  [ ] Take a ZFS snapshot
3.  [ ] Checkout repository to `/opt/scripts`
4.  [ ] Set permissions to root:root 755
5.  [ ] Copy `/home/novix/zfs` to `/opt/scripts/bin` directory and prefixed with `zfs-
6.  [ ] Set permissions for each script to `-x` (aka remove executable)
6.  [ ] Copy /var/lib/mastodon/run-* to `/opt/scripts/bin` directory and prefixed with `mastodon-`
7.  [ ] Submit each script family as a set of pull requests. e.g. zfs, mastodon

## Normalize script configuration
The scripts should be uniform and created so we can run them from `$PATH` and have the appropriate configuration to execute.

Any destructive scripts will require user interaction with the user approving the execution. (no more lost pancakes!)

For each script:
1.  [ ] Normalize the script to run from the path
2.  [ ] Set +x on the script
3.  [ ] Submit a PR for review.

## Create README describing how the process will work and describing what is linked
1.  [ ] Fill the README.md and submit as a PR.
